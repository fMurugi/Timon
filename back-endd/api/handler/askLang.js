//       1. Client Acquisition SOP      Identify potential clients through market research, referrals, and networking.   Reach out to potential clients via email or phone call to set up an initial consultation.   During initial consultation, determine clientâ€™s needs and how our services can help.   Prepare and send a proposal that outlines our services, fees, and terms.   Follow up with the client until a decision is made.      2. Project Planning SOP   Once a client contract is signed, assign a project manager to lead the project.   The project manager will conduct a kickoff meeting with the team to discuss project objectives, timelines, responsibilities, and resources.   Develop a detailed project plan outlining the tasks, timelines, and deliverables.   Share the project plan with the client for approval.      3. Client Communication SOP   Establish a primary point of contact for the client.   Regularly update the client on project status and any important developments.   Respond to client inquiries within 24 hours.   Conduct regular client meetings to discuss project progress and address any concerns.      4. Quality Assurance SOP   Review all deliverables for accuracy and completeness before sending to the client.   Conduct regular internal audits to ensure we are meeting our quality standards.   Regularly solicit client feedback to improve our services.      5. Billing SOP   Issue invoices according to the terms agreed in the contract.   Follow up with clients for timely payment.   Address any billing questions or disputes promptly and professionally.      6. Project Closure SOP   Once all deliverables have been submitted and approved by the client, close the project.   Conduct a project review meeting to discuss what went well and areas for improvement.   Send a project closure report to the client, thanking them for their business and asking for feedback.      7. Confidentiality SOP   All client information should be treated as confidential and only shared with team members on a need-to-know basis.   All employees must sign a confidentiality agreement.   Use secure methods to store and transmit client information.
